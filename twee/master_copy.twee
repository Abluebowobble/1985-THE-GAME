You reaffirm your conclusion in your hearts. But perhaps the full consequences have not dawned on you.

Out of the corner of your eye, you notice a piece of paper poking out from under your cheaply made keyboard.

You read the hastily scribbled note.

It says: Realised? [[Follow the path down the community centre.|2.6.1F]]

Your hair stands on its edge, it appears you controlled yourself from a facecrime.

You wake up again at your home.

Once again, you are greeted by the sight of your breezy home.

You do not know how, and nor do you question why.

Your body finished work, the Two Minutes Hate, and even your community centre participation. Yet your mind feels hazy.

Perhaps some [[sleep|2.7.1S]] will help.

Your years of crimestop pay their dues.

You decide to take one last [[look|2.8.7F]] around you before returning home.

The following functions only execute on PASSAGE RENDER.

This means to remove something, you need to make "buy cheese" link to another passage, which says "You bought the cheese" and execute the following functions to add to the inventory and subtract from the money. 

To add/subtract to the money amount:

<<script>>
if (State.history.length > 1) {
    const prev = State.history[State.history.length - 2].title;
    if (prev !== "Inventory") {
        State.variables.money += 10
    }
}
<</script>>

To add to the inventory:

<<script>>
if (State.history.length > 1) {
    const prev = State.history[State.history.length - 2].title;
    if (prev !== "Inventory") {
		State.variables.inventory.push("item")
    }
}
